# SCALIS CHALLENGE - Simple Full-Stack Application using Next.js

## About
This project is a demonstration of my proficiency in building production-ready full-stack applications, focusing on frontend, backend, testing, and version control. The application is built using `Next.js`, `NextAuth`, `Shadcn-ui`, `TailwindCSS`, `Vitest`, with `SQLite` for backend data storage and comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability.
